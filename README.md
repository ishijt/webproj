## UI design plan:
####Colors:
Primary Colors:
Light Blue (#5C809A) – used for backgrounds (e.g., header and footer).
White (#FFFFFF) – main color for backgrounds and to ensure text clarity.
Accent Colors:
Yellow (#F7D371) – used in buttons and highlighted elements.
Light Pink (#F47F7B) – used for hover effects, buttons, and selected elements.
Text Colors:
Dark Gray (#333333) – main color for text.
White (#FFFFFF) – used on dark backgrounds, such as in the footer and buttons.

####Fonts:
Main Font: Baloo – chosen for its modern appearance. It works well for both headings and body text.
Font Usage:
Headings: Centered.
Headings (h1, h2, h3): Use color #5C809A on all pages to ensure a consistent look.
Body Text: Medium-sized, balanced, and simple style (1.2rem).

####Style Guide:
Consistency: Every page uses consistent colors and fonts to create a clear and logical layout.
Responsiveness: The site adapts to different devices using the Bootstrap grid system.
Clear Navigation: Each page includes links in the top bar to sections (Homepage, Info, Scores, Games) for easy navigation.
User Feedback:
Hover Effect: Buttons change color to light pink (#F47F7B) to indicate interactivity.
Rounded corners and centered text ensure a user-friendly design.
